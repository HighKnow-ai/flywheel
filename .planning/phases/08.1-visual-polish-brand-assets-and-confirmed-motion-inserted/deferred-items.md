## Deferred Items

- `npm --prefix packages/desktop run build` (`tsc`) fails on three pre-existing test-file type errors unrelated to plan 08.1-01: `src/item-detail/__tests__/forge-section.test.tsx(352,64)`, `src/settings/__tests__/settings-surface.test.tsx(179,38)` and `(180,38)` — `TS2345: Argument of type 'RegExp' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'`. Plans that list `npm run build` as a gate cannot pass it until these are fixed; `npx tsc --noEmit` filtered to touched files is clean.
